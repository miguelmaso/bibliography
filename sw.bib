abstract  = {A new technique of free-space simulation has been developed for solving unbounded electromagnetic problems with the finite-difference time-domain method. Referred to as PML, the new technique is based on the use of an absorbing layer especially designed to absorb without reflection the electromagnetic waves. The first part of the paper presents the theory of the PML technique. The second part is devoted to numerical experiments and to numerical comparisons with the previously used techniques of free-space simulation. These comparisons show that the PML technique works better than the others in all cases; using it allows us to obtain a higher accuracy in some problems and a release of computational requirements in some others.}

Then well-posed results are presented when the time discretization is done by the characteristic-based semi-Lagrange method and the space discretization is done by two variants of the mixed finite element methods. Since the mixed finite element discretization is related to the staggered finite difference schemes extensively used in geophysical models, the results points to how the transparent boundary conditions can be used in the finite difference discretization.}

@book{raviart1996,
abstract  = {This work is devoted to the theory and approximation of nonlinear hyper­ bolic systems of conservation laws in one or two space variables. It follows directly a previous publication on hyperbolic systems of conservation laws by the same authors, and we shall make frequent references to Godlewski and Raviart (1991) (hereafter noted G. R. ), though the present volume can be read independently. This earlier publication, apart from a first chap­ ter, especially covered the scalar case. Thus, we shall detail here neither the mathematical theory of multidimensional scalar conservation laws nor their approximation in the one-dimensional case by finite-difference con­ servative schemes, both of which were treated in G. R. , but we shall mostly consider systems. The theory for systems is in fact much more difficult and not at all completed. This explains why we shall mainly concentrate on some theoretical aspects that are needed in the applications, such as the solution of the Riemann problem, with occasional insights into more sophisticated problems. The present book is divided into six chapters, including an introductory chapter. For the reader's convenience, we shall resume in this Introduction the notions that are necessary for a self-sufficient understanding of this book -the main definitions of hyperbolicity, weak solutions, and entropy­ present the practical examples that will be thoroughly developed in the following chapters, and recall the main results concerning the scalar case.},
