abstract  = {A new technique of free-space simulation has been developed for solving unbounded electromagnetic problems with the finite-difference time-domain method. Referred to as PML, the new technique is based on the use of an absorbing layer especially designed to absorb without reflection the electromagnetic waves. The first part of the paper presents the theory of the PML technique. The second part is devoted to numerical experiments and to numerical comparisons with the previously used techniques of free-space simulation. These comparisons show that the PML technique works better than the others in all cases; using it allows us to obtain a higher accuracy in some problems and a release of computational requirements in some others.}

abstract  = {This paper describes a class of explicit, Eulerian finite-difference algorithms for solving the continuity equation which are built around a technique called “flux correction.” These flux-corrected transport algorithms are of indeterminate order but yield realistic, accurate results. In addition to the mass-conserving property of most conventional algorithms, the FCT algorithms strictly maintain the positivity of actual mass densities so steep gradients and inviscid shocks are handled particularly well. This first paper concentrates on a simple one-dimensional version of FCT utilizing SHASTA, a new transport algorithm for the continuity equation, which is described in detail.}

abstract  = {An algebraic approach to the design of multidimensional high-resolution schemes is introduced and elucidated in the finite element context. A centered space discretization of unstable convective terms is rendered local extremum diminishing by a conservative elimination of negative off-diagonal coefficients from the discrete transport operator. This modification leads to an upwind-biased low-order scheme which is nonoscillatory but overly diffusive. In order to reduce the incurred error, a limited amount of compensating antidiffusion is added in regions where the solution is sufficiently smooth. Two closely related flux correction strategies are presented. The first one is based on a multidimensional generalization of total variation diminishing (TVD) schemes, whereas the second one represents an extension of the FEM-FCT paradigm to implicit time-stepping. Nonlinear algebraic systems are solved by an iterative defect correction scheme preconditioned by the low-order evolution operator which enjoys the M-matrix property. The dffusive and antidiffusive terms are represented as a sum of antisymmetric internodal fluxes which are constructed edge-by-edge and inserted into the global defect vector. The new methodology is applied to scalar transport equations discretized in space by the Galerkin method. Its performance is illustrated by numerical examples for 2D benchmark problems.}

abstract  = {Algebraic flux correction schemes of TVD and FCT type are extended to systems of hyperbolic conservation laws. The group finite element formulation is employed for the treatment of the compressible Euler equations. An efficient algorithm is proposed for the edge-by-edge matrix assembly. A generalization of Roe's approximate Riemann solver is derived by rendering all off-diagonal matrix blocks positive semi-definite. Another usable low-order method is constructed by adding scalar artificial viscosity proportional to the spectral radius of the cumulative Roe matrix. The limiting of antidiffusive fluxes is performed using a transformation to the characteristic variables or a suitable synchronization of correction factors for the conservative ones. The outer defect correction loop is equipped with a block-diagonal preconditioner so as to decouple the discretized Euler equations and solve them in a segregated fashion. As an alternative, a strongly coupled solution strategy (global BiCGSTAB method with a block-Gau{\ss}-Seidel preconditioner) is introduced for applications which call for the use of large time steps. Various algorithmic aspects including the implementation of characteristic boundary conditions are addressed. Simulation results are presented for inviscid flows in a wide range of Mach numbers.}

Then well-posed results are presented when the time discretization is done by the characteristic-based semi-Lagrange method and the space discretization is done by two variants of the mixed finite element methods. Since the mixed finite element discretization is related to the staggered finite difference schemes extensively used in geophysical models, the results points to how the transparent boundary conditions can be used in the finite difference discretization.}

abstract  = {Abstract In 1923 Ekman developed a theory for the sea-level changes produced in a deep sea by the action of a steady wind. In the present paper the theory has been extended to a shallow sea, for which the Ekman “depth of frictional influence” d is comparable to the actual depth h. It is pointed out that the wind-stress divergence may be of the same importance as the wind-stress curl in this case. The theory is furthermore extended to the transient case. It is demonstrated how the velocity profile and the flow can be expressed in terms of the local time-histories of the wind-stress and the surface slope, and a single integro-differential equation is derived for the sea-level elevation. This equation could possibly be used for prediction of meteorologic tides and storm surges.},
